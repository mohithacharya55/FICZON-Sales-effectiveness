# FICZON-Sales-effectiveness
#📌 Project Overview
FicZon Inc. is an IT solution provider offering both on-premises and SaaS-based solutions. The primary channel for lead generation is digital, particularly through their website. FicZon relies heavily on sales force effectiveness for business growth. However, with increasing market competition, the company has observed a decline in sales.

Currently, lead quality is manually categorized by sales staff, making the process subjective and dependent on individual expertise. Although a quality process exists to update lead categorization, its impact is primarily for post-analysis rather than real-time conversion improvement.

To address this challenge, FicZon seeks to implement a Machine Learning solution to pre-categorize lead quality, enhancing sales effectiveness and improving business outcomes.
